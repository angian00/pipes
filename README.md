# Pipes
A clone of the old DOS game [Pipes -- aka PipeMania](https://www.freegameempire.com/games/Pipe), implemented with libgdx.

## CREDITS
The game has been developed using Java language and the [LibGDX library](https://libgdx.com/). 

The graphics are original, as can be evinced by their primitive quality.

Most sound effects are based on free samples hosted on [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/).
I have done only minor modifications (trimming, fadeouts, amplifying where needed).

In particular, I've used the following files, under a [Creative Commons 0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license:

Furthermore, I have extracted chronometer sounds from a [skiing youtube video](
